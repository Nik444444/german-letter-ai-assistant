        comment: "CRITICAL: Frontend application not loading properly. Browser automation tool unable to access localhost URLs, keeps redirecting to production URL (https://german-letter-ai-assistant.onrender.com) which returns 404 errors. Local servers are running (localhost:3000 and localhost:3001) and serving content correctly via curl, but browser automation cannot access them. This prevents testing of Russian language functionality, file upload, and analysis features."

    message: "CRITICAL ISSUE: Browser automation tool is not respecting localhost URLs and keeps redirecting to production URL which returns 404. Local frontend servers are running correctly on ports 3000 and 3001, serving HTML and React bundle properly. However, browser automation cannot access these local URLs for testing. This is a system-level issue preventing any UI testing. Need to investigate browser automation configuration or use alternative testing approach."
